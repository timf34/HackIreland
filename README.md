# Hack Ireland 

## TODO:

- [ ] Add "view on github" or similar to the footer! 
- [ ] Add a screenshot of GIF of the website here! 
- [ ] Consider changing "Hack Ireland" or other font to like this guy has in the "Making Software" title: https://x.com/DanHollick/status/1873346283945246763
    - I think this wouldn't work the best with the grid background actually... unless I was to add some sort of buffer between it... Consistency of the current title/ logo is good. Use this font elsewhere though 100% For tht titles in the popup boxes I think!
