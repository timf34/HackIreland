# Hack Ireland 

## TODO:

- [ ] Add "view on github" or similar to the footer! 
- [ ] Add a screenshot of GIF of the website here! 
- [ ] Definitely post this to Twitter when the time comes round - perhaps a GIF then too (similar to the girl who did the new personal website update with the scramble effect potentially)
- [ ] Consider changing "Hack Ireland" or other font to like this guy has in the "Making Software" title: https://x.com/DanHollick/status/1873346283945246763
